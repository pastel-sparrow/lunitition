Client's Current Website Design.

With the client’s current website design that is live,[11] there is
multiple issues that I would like to address. With using the home page as a
reference, I’ll be explaining the issues of the whole website.

Firstly, in the top left hand corner (Where your eyes are most likely to go,
if you are a new user to the page) you will see the client’s social media
platforms (Being Facebook, Twitter & YouTube). Also as a side note the
YouTube & Facebook have not been updated in years. On the right hand side
of the same bar, you have not either of the Client’s business name or their
colloquially known time. But the quote “Ofsted say we are Good!” along with
a phone number, but there is nothing to say that this is the client’s
number, rather that it would be Ofsted’s contact number rather than the
client’s. The first true image is the SHIFT logo along with a random stock
image. The next section is two links, one of the links is linking to an old
blog that was last updated back in 2016.

--------

With the client's website it does have multiple issues but it does have
some redeeming qualities compared to other website's that would be seen as
the client's rival. With the faults of the client's website, there are many
issues that could be fixed however in my personal opinion, however as there
are so many issues, I would advise the client to build the website from the
ground up.
