[16th Feburary, 2003]
Left side nav bar
 5 new internal webpages
  "What's On" (what.htm)
  "Coming up" (coming.html)
  "People at Shift" (people.html)
  "Guestbook" (guestbook.pl)
  "Links" (links.html)
  "Home Page" (index.html)

- A couple of images are broken due to the engine that makes the cache of the website.
- Contact details on the same page as events.
- All of the new pages are dead links, I am assuming that the links that are one the website in this version are only a proof of concept or a holding
  place for when the new webpages get uploaded to the server.
